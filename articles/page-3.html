                    <h1>Sephiroth Introduction</h1>

                  <p>Sephiroth is the main antagonist of <cite>Final Fantasy VII</cite> and <cite>Final Fantasy VII Remake</cite> and one of the primary antagonists in its extended universe. In spin-off appearances, Sephiroth is depicted as Cloud Strife's archenemy and is seen as a symbol of Cloud's troubled past haunting him. Sephiroth is a former renowned <cite>SOLDIER</cite> who became twisted. </p>

            <h2>Appearances</h2>

                <p>Sephiroth is a tall man with a muscular build. His long silver hair has bangs parted to either side of his face. In <cite>Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-</cite>, the bangs are shorter. Sephiroth has green cat-like eyes Sephiroth <cite>E3 2019 VII Remake</cite>. He wears a long black coat with silver pauldrons, black boots and black trousers. The top of his coat is open to reveal his chest, with his leather SOLDIER suspenders crossed over it. In <cite>Final Fantasy VII Remake</cite>, he has a different belt buckle with a wing motif in the center and small black feathers hanging from it; yellow and green lights reflect from the slots, which may be materia Sephiroths belt from FFVII Remake.<br><br>

                  He wields the Masamune (usually two-handed), a seven-foot-long ōdachi he is rarely seen without. His battle stance with the sword is to hold it over his left shoulder with the blade curving downward, known in the Japanese sword stance as <cite>Te Ura Gasumi No Kamae</cite>, which is primarily used in <cite>Ninjitsu and Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū</cite>, the latter of which is one of the oldest extant martial arts.</p>

            <h2>Backstory</h2>

                <p>As Shinra sealed Sephiroth's records, most guides do not give any personal details. The European and North American manuals give his details as "unknown" except for his job as a top-ranking SOLDIER officer, that he fights with Long Swords, and his height. An alien named JENOVA came to earth and was mistaken as one of the Cetra, an ancient people who had the power to "talk to the planet". Professor Hojo took cell from JENOVA and injected these cells into a lady named Lucrecia's baby which in turn created Sephiroth.
                    <br><br>
                Sephiroth never gained the ability to talk to the planet, as he is not a Cetra descendant. Shinra noticed his exceptional physical prowess and raised him to be a super-soldier. Sephiroth's success still advanced the Jenova Project, leading to the creation of SOLDIER. Shinra told him nothing of his true parentage, and he grew up believing his mother's name was "Jenova". Sephiroth felt different from other children but didn't know of the experiments that had created him. Sephiroth came to respect Professor Gast, deeming him a great scientist. He despised Professor Hojo, considering him a hack scientist compared to Gast and a "walking mess of complexes".

                During the Wutai War Sephiroth was instrumental in ensuring Shinra's dominance. He rose to the rank of SOLDIER First Class and was admired and respected as a great war hero. Those in Shinra considered his strength unequaled even by other First Class SOLDIER members. Many young men, including Cloud Strife and Genesis Rhapsodos, idolized Sephiroth and sought to join SOLDIER to become heroes like him, making Sephiroth useful for Shinra as a propaganda tool. </p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>

                <p>Sephiroth is regarded as the greatest SOLDIER 1st Class of all time, whose legendary accomplishments in the field of battle inspired many to join SOLDIER. His greatest strength is his swordsmanship and inhuman physical prowess stemming from his success as a byproduct of the Jenova Project, his power having inspired Shinra to create SOLDIER in the first place. Hailed as the strongest swordsman, he is the only one capable of effectively wielding his Masamune, an ōdachi that is longer than he is tall, which he uses effortlessly with a single hand, ambidextrously able to shift from his left to right hand with no loss of efficiency. He can slash faster than the human eye can see and with enough force to cut through steel and concrete. Sephiroth's combat capabilities outmatch virtually every opponent he encounters in terms of both power and skill. He is also highly resilient, able to endure grievous physical damage and continue to fight. His physical strength was also such that he could rip bolted down metal structures via his own bare hands with minimal effort. </p>
