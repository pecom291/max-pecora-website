			<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>An arrogant and proud swordsman at first, Cloud introduces himself to Avalanche as a former member of an elite warrior unit called SOLDIER who has turned mercenary, and uninterested in anything beyond his hired task at hand. Beneath his hardened outer persona is a softer, more caring individual who simply struggles to open up, but is striving to be a hero. Cloud later discovers more about his past and, with the help of his friends, learns there is more to being a hero than possessing physical strength and fame. He develops compassion for the planet and the people he fights to protect from the Shinra Electric Power Company and his
				nemesis, Sephiroth.</p>

			<h2>Backstory</h2>

				<p>Cloud Stride despite what he says was never actually a member of SOLDIER but a failed experiement in trying to replicate the super soldier known as Sephiroth. He grew up with his best friend Tifa until he was old enough to try the training to get into SOLDIER. During his training he met Zack Fair, a member of SOLDIER who would end up saving his life time and time again. After he failed SOLIDER training he was experimented on and then taken in by someone named Docotor Hojo, who proformed experiments on him to attempt to remake him into Sephiroth. These too failed however he was put into a vegative state and given the memorize of Zack. Zack breaks them out of their experimentations and ultimately takes the vegative Cloud with him. On the run Zack hides Cloud and dies protecting him by having to fight against the entirety of the Shina Army. Cloud happens to find Zack shortly before he passes away as a bloody mess and is asked to live and carry on his legacy. This is really where Cloud first becomes the character we all know and love as he is given the Buster Sword (which is the primary sword of Zack Fair).</p>

			<h2>Gameplay</h2>

				<p>Cloud Strife wields large broadswords in battle, including the iconic Buster Sword, and is a versatile melee combatant. In <cite>Final Fantasy VII</cite>, he has access to the most powerful weapons in the game, as well as the strongest Limit abilities (all of which involve his sword), though they take the longest to learn. In <cite>Final Fantasy VII Remake</cite>, Cloud's strength is in his raw damage output and his versatility, able to switch back-and-forth between the agile Operator Mode and the more offensive Punisher Mode that allows him to counterattack. In both titles, Cloud has the best all-around stats.</p>
